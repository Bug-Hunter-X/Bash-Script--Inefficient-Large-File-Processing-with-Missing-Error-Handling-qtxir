# Bash Script Bug: Large File Processing

This repository demonstrates a common bug in Bash scripts when processing large files: inefficient memory usage and lack of robust error handling. 

The `bug.sh` script attempts to read and process a large file line by line.  However, it lacks proper error checks and could lead to issues with files that are exceptionally large, exceeding available system memory.

The `bugSolution.sh` script provides an improved version with enhanced error handling and more efficient memory management.

## How to reproduce

1. Create a large file named `large_file.txt` (e.g., using `head /dev/urandom | tr -dc A-Za-z0-9\n | head -c 100M > large_file.txt`)
2. Run `bug.sh` and observe potential issues.
3. Run `bugSolution.sh` and compare the results.

## Bug and Solution Explanation

The bug lies in the lack of efficient memory management and error handling.  The original script reads the entire file into memory, which is inefficient for very large files.  The solution addresses this by using a more efficient method to iterate through the file line by line without loading the whole file into memory at once, and incorporating robust error handling for file operations.
